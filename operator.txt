What is operators?
-------------------
Operators are symbols used to process data and give some result. 
for example +, -, /, * these some operators example.

each operators work upon 1 or 2 or 3 value. 
    operators which works upon one value is called unary operators
    operators which works upon two value is called binary operators
    operators which works upon three value is called ternary operators

binary operators.
    binary operators has two value, one value on left and one value on right side of operators
    example 
        c = a + b
        d = a - b 
        x = a * b 

    categories of operators

        athematic operators 
            are used to mathematical operations  for example +,-,*,/,% 

        relational/comparison operators

            are used to compare values. relational operators always return only true/1 or false/0. 
             
             == equal to (are used to compare 2 values, if both are value are same it give true else false)

             result = a==b (assume a = 10 and b = 20) 

             != not equal to (are used to compare 2 values, if both are value are not same it give true else false)
             result = a!=b (assume a = 10 and b = 10) 
             
             < less then (used to check whether 1st value is less then 2nd value, if yes it return true else false)
             result = a<b (assume a = 10 and b = 50) 
             
             > greater then (used to check whether 1st value is greater then 2nd value, if yes it return true else false)
             result = a>b  (assume a = 10 and b = 5) 
             
             <= less then or equal to (used to check whether 1st value is less or equal to 2nd value, if yes it return true else false)
             result = a<=b (assume a = 11 and b = 10) 
             
             >= greater then or equal to  (used to check whether 1st value is greater then or equal to 2nd value, if yes it return true else false)
             result = a>=b (assume a = 14 and b = 15) 

        logical operators
            used to combine two or more relational expression imagine situaltion where you need to compare a with b & b with c. you will use relational operators twice then you have to put logical operators between two relational expression. 
                && and (return true if both relational expression are true otherwise false)
                || or  (return true if any one or both relational expression are true otherwise false)
                !  not (return compliments )
            a == b && b == c
            a == b || b == c
            ! a == b 

        assignment operators
            assignment operators are used to assign value to variables. one vary useful assignment operators are = other useful assignment operators also called shortend assignment operators
                += it is used a+=b in case of a = a + b
                -= it is used a-=b in case of a = a - b
                *= it is used a*=b in case of a = a * b
                /= it is used a/=b in case of a = a / b
                %= it is used a%=b in case of a = a % b

        unary operators
        operators which works upon one value is called unary operators

        prefix 
            a = a + 1 can be written as ++a;

        postfix
            postfix example 
            assume a = 10
            b = a++ // b = 10 and a = 11
